# #darkshare

A service where you can share some of your stuff.
This site is spit into tree sections:

1. Snippets. This can be varying from code, confessions or the new @lulsec v0.lulz release. Who knows man...
2. Files. They are MAX 6MB, and you can upload them here.
3. Urls. They are normally long, and you can short them here.


## Why anon?

Well if you don't like it, just sign up and a username will be added to your posts. Cool right?
Also I've disabled all logs for this website on the server, so I can't back up anybodys ass. Sorry NSA.
*I'm not really sorry, but yea..*

# Content from frontpage

## Welcome to #darkshare

Hopefully, a place where all kinds of people can share stuff.

### What is #darkshare?
It is a service that let's you share stuff. Simple as that. <br/>
Although, since I'm maintaining this on my spare time and from my own wallet,
I've had the need to restrict some parts of the service. I.e. you can only share files <= 6 megabytes.
I know, it sucks.

### Can I use this for bad things?

Well, sure you can.
**BUT NOTICE**, if I get a complaint against something you darksharers put up on here, I am entitled to put it down imidiately, without noticing you. Or, probably I'll tell everyone that you've been a bad boy.
*(Worst case senario I'll have to block your user, and destroy your associated content, **forever**).*

### Can you add/fix this?
Yes I can!
If you're awesome, please go to my [http://github.com/jstoone/darkshare/issues](Github Issues) and submit your feature or bug. That would be nice!

If that's a bit too much you can always email me. Let's do some manual obfuscating:

```php
<?php
    $username = "jakobsteinn";
    $seperator = "@";
    $provider = "lavaboom";
    $domain = ".com";

    $email = $username . $seperator . $provider . $domain
?>
```
